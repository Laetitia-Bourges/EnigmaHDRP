# EnigmaHDRP

This project was an exercice during my trainning in gameplay programming.
I had 5 days maximum to finish it

I had to program the encryption and decryption system of the Enigma machine, which was used by the Germans during WWII.

There is a system with 3 rotors where each of them encrypts a letter according to a specific pattern.

This project uses the JsonUtility library to retrieve the patterns of the rotors and to create a file containing the message encrypted on the PC when the COPY button is pressed.
